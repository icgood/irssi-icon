irssi-icon
==========

This small daemon serves two basic functions:
 * At startup, it starts a screen session called "irssi" running irssi.
 * Provides a status-bar icon with notification emblems when you have new
   private messages or messages in a channel you have joined.
 * Clicking the icon clears notifications and can execute a customizable
   shell command, e.g. to toggle display of irssi. Calling irssi-icon with
   --clear will also clear notifications.

Installation
============

Install:

    sudo pip install irssi-icon

Execute:

    irssi-icon

For a description of (optional) command-line arguments, see --help.
