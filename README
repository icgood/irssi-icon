irssi-icon.py
=============

This small daemon serves two basic functions:
 * At startup, it starts a screen session called "irssi" running irssi.
 * Provides a status-bar icon with notification emblems when you have new
   private messages or messages in a channel you have joined.
 * Clicking the icon clears notifications and can execute a customizable
   shell command, e.g. to toggle display of irssi.

For a description of (optional) command-line arguments, see --help.

--------------

Personally, I recommend using the Guake terminal (http://guake.org/) and
attaching the irssi screen session within it. Then, you can use the command
"guake -t" as your on-click action to toggle displaying of irssi on top of
whatever you are currently working on. Finally, in your desktop environment,
bind a key (I use Alt-`) to "irssi-icon.py --click".
